#' Prepare raw rosette size data for further analysis.
#'
#' Estimate genetic values for each line from the phenotype data by fitting
#' BLUPs.
#'
#'
#' Inputs:
#'    Raw data file for rosette size including replicate lines 1 and 2 and parents
#'    from the growth-room phenotyping experiment.
#'
#' Outputs:
#'    Tab-separated text files formatted for GEMMA.
#'    The first column is a vector of 1s to tell GEMMA to fit an intercept.
#'    Subsequent columns show genotype and BLUP estimates of
#'    genetic values of rosette size. There are separate file for replicate lines
#'    1 and 2, plus the parents.
#'    Output files are in the same order as the genotype files, with missing
#'    phenotype values where necessary.

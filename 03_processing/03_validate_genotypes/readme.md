# Validation of the F8 genotypes

This directory contains attempts to validate the F8 genotypes by comparing them to known genotypes of the parents in the published SNP matrix.

1. Using SNPmatch
2. Visually, using ibdpainting.

The most informative results are summarised in `06_ibd_painting_results.md` and the HTML it generates.

Scripts to process 91 F8 samples and two parents (1137 and 1074) that were
resequenced at higher coverage.

These samples were identified as:
- having haplotypes that didn't match the parents
- Having amiguous parentage
- having failed to sequence at all
- being a missing parent (accession 1074 and 1137)
- having a missing parent

Raw data is in `01_data/08_resequenced_F8s`.

These scripts call SNPs for these samples and validate the genotypes.

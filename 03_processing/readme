Scripts to prepare and check sequencing data for the F8s

Tom Ellis, December 2023

The goal here is to create a VCF file containing SNP data for the F8s, and verify
the genotypes using SNPmatch. A second goal is to process phenotype data.

It is clear that there have been mix ups in what was crossed, grown or sequenced
at some point. 
Pieter put a lot of effort into correcting the sample sheet based on SNPmatch
results, and it seems silly to waste this. On the other hand this involved a
lot of manual annotation, which I cannot always trace. The most worrying 
thing is that the results of this still give SNPmatch mismatches with samples
Pieter labelled as matching.

So, while having accurate genotypes is ideal it is not necessarily clear that 
this is possible, and attempting to do so risks disappearing down a rabbit hole.

As such, I have currently taken three approaches:

1. Scripts in `original_sample_sheet` starts from scratch with the original
    sample sheet on the NGS master list. It then trims and aligns reads, creates
    a VCF file and checks it with SNPmatch (see the script headers for details).
    There are lots of mismatches. Most of the processing is done on scratch-cbe,
    and the VCF file and SNPmatch results are staged out to the output folder.
2. Scripts in `pieters_sample_sheet` does the same as (1) but starts with
    *_corrected* sample sheets annotated by Pieter. Scripts should be the same
    as for (1). There are still some mismatches.
3. Scripts in `pieters_VCF` takes the VCF file generated by Pieter and changes 
    the sample names. Pieters used absolute paths to raw BAM files, so I swap
    them to sample names.

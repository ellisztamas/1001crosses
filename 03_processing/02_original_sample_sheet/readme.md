Scripts to extract raw sequencing data for the F8s and call SNPs at known 
variable SNP positions.

Samples are processed using the plate and well position information in the
sample sheet, because I was treated the genotypes as preliminary until I could
validate them.

Script names should be fairly informative.
See the explanation within each script for more details.

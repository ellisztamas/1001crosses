I have been having trouble validating genotypes.
Pieter previously called SNPs and valdidated genotypes, but unfortunately did not
write down how. In the absence of data I can validate myself, I am using his 
VCF file.

Scripts in this directory format Pieter's files for analysis to rename the samples,
ensure the genotypes match, and ensure that parents and F8 VCF files contain the
same number of SNPs.

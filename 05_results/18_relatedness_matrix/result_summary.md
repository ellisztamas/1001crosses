# Shape of relatedness matrices

**Date:** 22nd May 2025
**Author:** Tom Ellis

## Background

Compare the shape and spread of values in relatedness matrices in parents and
F8s

## What did you do?

- `01_calculate_matrices.sh` uses plink to calculate pairwise relatedness
- `02_relatedness_matrices.qmd` explores the results

## Main conclusion

Relatedness is skewed right in both generations.
In the F8s the skew is due to sharing one or two parents.
In parents the skew is more severe.
Accessions with more close relatives tend to be from the extremes of PCs 1 and 2.

## Caveats

Need to check the GPS data tbh.

## Follow-up

## Background

Plot the decay in linkage disequilibrium over short distances.

## What did you do?

- `01_get_LD.sh` calculates LD as R2 and D in plink.
- `02_plot_LD.R` plots the results (as R2)
- `03_plot_D.R` plots the decay in D.

## Main conclusion

D decays faster in the F8s than the parents, and bottoms out at a lower level.

## Caveats

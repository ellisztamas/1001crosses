#' Prepare flowering-time data the parents for GWAS.
#'
#' Import data on number of days to flowering at 10Â°C for the parents and format
#' for running GEMMA.
#'
#' To do: consider subsetting the parents to match those in each offspring file.
#' This may not be necessary, because if we split F8s by replicate sample sizes
#' are very similar.
#'
#' Input: Flowering-time data for the F8s and parents
#' Output: PLINK formatted phenotype and covariate files for GEMMA

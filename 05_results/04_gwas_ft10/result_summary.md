# GWAS on flowering time (external data)

**Date:** 18th December 2023
**Author:** Tom Ellis

## Background

GWAS results for flowering time using data from Pieter.
As far as I can tell this is flowering time at 10Â°C for the parents measured in 
a different paper, and in the F8s measured by Joanna.

## What did you do?

- Script names are pretty self-explanatory here.

## Main conclusion

There are actually some peaks, but it's not really clear if they are stronger in
the parents or the F8s.
Scatter plots of effect sizes seem to increase more sharply than 1:1. I don't 
really know what that means.

## Caveats

The data are questionable!

## Follow-up

I did a proper phenotyping experiment with parents and F9s grown in a common 
enviroment, and with replication.

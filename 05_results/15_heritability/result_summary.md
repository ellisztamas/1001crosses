# Heritability

**Date:** 13th January 2025

## Background

Calculate broad-sense heritability of flowering time from the phenotyping experiment.
This is the variance explained by genotype means, not SNP-heritability.

## What did you do?

Scripts estimate broad-sense heritability as a random effect of var between genotypes.

## Main conclusion

- For all traits, variance components are pretty consistent between cohorts.
- Flowering time is really heritable.
- Rosette size H2~0.4 for parents and F9 cohort 1, but only 0.23 for cohort 2.
  - Differences between measurements are a similar magnitude.
- Seed size is H2~0.3.
  - Big differences between mothers.

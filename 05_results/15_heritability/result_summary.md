## Background

Calculate broad-sense heritability of flowering time from the phenotyping experiment.
This is the variance explained by genotype means, not SNP-heritability.

## What did you do?

Scripts estimate broad-sense heritability as a random effect of var between genotypes.

## Main conclusion

Flowering time is really heritable.
Rosette size much less so.

## Caveats


## Follow-up

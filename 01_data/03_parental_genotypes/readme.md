# SNPs from the 1001 genomes project

File name:
`1163g.179kB.prior15.gauss4.ts99.5.BIALLELIC.vcf.gz`

Sequence data for the parents are taken from a VCF file produced by Fernando
Rabanal from

> Brachi, Benjamin, et al. "Plant genetic effects on microbial hubs impact host fitness in repeated field trials."Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 119.30 (2022): e2201285119

This is a reanalysis of previously published data from the [1001 genomes project](https://1001genomes.org/)
updated with newer SNP calling methods.

Note that accessions 1137 and 1074 are included as parents of crosses, but are
not in this VCF file.

# Imputed SNPs for the rest of the RegMap dataset

Filename:

Seed size data I got from other people.

- 1001_2014_2017_2022_boxeed.csv
    Data from Tal Dahan of measurements of seed size from the 2014, 2017 and
    2022 bulk collections of the 1001 collection measured by Labdeers.
- raw_data_seed_size_F9.csv
    Data from Tal Dahan of measurements of seed size in the F8s measured by Labdeers.
- seed_size_swedes_field_updated.csv
    Envel Keffradec's seed size data measured in the field (?)
- seed_size_swedes_lab_updated.csv 
    Envel Keffradec's seed size data measured in the lab (?)

I will probably not use these data because I repeated this in the phenotyping 
experiment.

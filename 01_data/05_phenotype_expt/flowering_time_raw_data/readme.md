Flowering time data collected by Almudena Molla Morales.

Almudena used an app for checking inventories.
She scanned each pot that flowered on each day into a separate database.
File names give:

- Date of observation (i.e. flowering date)
- Date she exported the file (31st May 2024)
- Something else created by the app (34631). We think this might be time of export, i.e. 3:46:31 in the afternoon

For example, the file 202405222024053134631.csv is for the 22nd May 2024.

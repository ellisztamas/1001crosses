Data on flowering time that I found in Pieter's folders:

- flowering_time_10C_parents.csv
    Flowering time data from 2014 taken from Fernando's files. It is not clear
    how they were measured
- flowering_time_F8s.csv
    Flowering time on the F8 plants used for sequencing. This was done by
    Joanna Gunis. We decided not to use this, because the parents were grown 
    separately.

These are deprecated because:

- there is no replication
- I am not sure where they came from
- Randomisation is unclear.
